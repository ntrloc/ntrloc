// edit tree plus a delete flag) is genuinely the same concept, just resolved from
// link_property:write/link:delete grants instead of property:write/item:delete ones. Null both
// when the caller's ProjectionSpec didn't ask for permissions at all (the common case -- see
// ProjectionSpec.includePermissions) and, within a leaf edit tree, wherever nothing is writable.
